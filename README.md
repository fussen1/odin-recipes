# odin-recipes
In this project, i am going to build a basic recipe website.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

- Create a new repo for this project on GitHub.com and call it odin-recipes.
- Move that repository onto your local machine, inside the repos folder that was previously created in the Git Basics lesson. The command should look like <git clone git@github.com:username/odin-recipes.git> (use SSH).
- Now cd into the odin-recipes project directory that is now on the local machine.
