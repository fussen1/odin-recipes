# odin-recipes
In this project, i am going to build a basic recipe website.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
<br>
<b>First steps:</b>
- Create a new repo for this project on GitHub.com and call it <em>odin-recipes</em>.
- Move that repository onto your local machine, inside the <em>repos</em> folder that was previously created in the Git Basics lesson. The command should look like <em>git clone git@github.com:username/odin-recipes.git</em> (use SSH).
- Now <em>cd</em> into the <em>odin-recipes</em> project directory that is now on the local machine.
